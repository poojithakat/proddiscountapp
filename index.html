				<h3> Academic goals: </h3>
				<p> I always believe this short saying from my heart: “Enlarge your vision”. Life, being a constant learning process to me, offers numerous opportunities to apply the motto in its every sphere – academic, personal and professional. My undergraduate studies in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering provided me an exposure to both theoretical and practical aspects of engineering. Through the many opportunities I had there, I found a deep interest in research work and a strong aptitude for the type of problem solving and problem discovery that it involves. This made me incline towards the data analytics and data mining, and here I am pursuing Master's in Information systems at NJIT. </p>

      <div class="professional">
				<h3> professional goals: </h3>

I always look forward to learning new concepts, and applying this knowledge to cater to the needs of my company in the future. </p>
